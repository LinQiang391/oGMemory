# Disable Bonjour / mDNS by default. With network_mode: host the openclaw
# container shares the host's interface list (eth0, wlan0, docker0, ...);
# the ciao probe packet that the responder fires at startup then includes
# an A/AAAA record per interface and blows past the 1440-byte UDP MTU
# (`AssertionError: Probe query packet exceeds the mtu size (2115>1440)`),
# which crashes the gateway. mDNS over a host-network container also serves
# no real purpose — the multicast stays on the host loopback and isn't
# discoverable from other devices. Operators who actually want LAN
# discovery can `unset OPENCLAW_DISABLE_BONJOUR` or run on bridge network.
